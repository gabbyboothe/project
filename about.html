    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi I am Gabby Boothe I am a currently working towards my computer sciecne degree
        to become a software developer. Coding first caught my attention in 6th grade when we had 
    a "coding day". My teacher at the time coded for fun/was learning and had us learn how to 
make a little game. We went on a website and it walked us through simple motions in the game.
I was so excited and fascinated by what i made, i was playing in a game i had just coded.
Then in highschool i took coding classes my school was offering and now im in college wrapping up my first 
year.  </p>
